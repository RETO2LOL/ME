# Codex handoff

## 2026-09-20 — responsive projects and Manrope typography

Read this entry first, then the September 10 notes for navigation and reveals.

### Current appearance

- Replaced Birthstone with Manrope (400–800) via Google Fonts in both HTML
  entry points. Host styles use `--font-sans`; the React mount roots define the
  same stack. System sans-serif fonts are the fallback. Heading sizes now scale
  with the viewport; retain the monochrome surfaces and existing header artwork.
- Projects use semantic `article` cards with a framed square image and caption.
  The user's `public/MPDimage.png` keeps its original colors and proportions.
  Its image links to `https://github.com/RETO2LOL/MusicPlayer_for_MPD`, with an
  accessible link label and an inset keyboard focus outline.
- The grid uses three columns above 900 px, two from 561–900 px, and one at
  560 px or narrower. On phones, future-project placeholders become compact
  horizontal rows. Project surfaces, borders, and muted text have theme tokens.
- The hero object now scales within the viewport, preserving the original SVG.
  Hero buttons wrap and use theme-aware text colors.
- Preserve the September 10 repeat-on-entry reveals, dots, navigation mapping,
  theme persistence, and reduced-motion behavior.

### Implementation and verification

Files: `index.html`, `style.css`, `public/MPDimage.png`, React `index.html`,
`src/App.css`, `src/index.css`, and the regenerated tracked `dist` assets.
Always run `npm run build` in `my-react-widget/` after React source changes;
the host page loads the built bundle rather than the source files.

The production build and whitespace checks passed. Firefox checks at 320, 390,
560, 768, 900, 1024, and 1440 px covered both themes, column counts, image
loading/proportions, visible sections, and absence of horizontal overflow.
Manrope loaded successfully; reduced-motion reveals and JavaScript error checks
also passed. Mobile checks were repeated after compacting the placeholders.
External icon, CAPTCHA, and animation-runtime requests were blocked during
these checks; contact delivery was not retested.

Temporary browser scripts/screenshots live under `/tmp/mpd-review-tools/` and
`/tmp/portfolio-*.png`; do not rely on them surviving another session.
The handoff is explicitly included in this commit despite `cloude/` being
ignored. The older conversation log stays local. Old deployment and credential
follow-ups remain unverified; check current status before acting on them.

## 2026-09-10 — scrolling, reveals, and responsive controls

Read this entry before the older `save_conversatioin.txt` log. It supersedes
the old observer targets, navbar mappings, and one-time reveal behavior.

### Current behavior

- The four host sections are `#home`, `#projects`, `#about`, and `#contact`.
  Each has `data-nav-section` and `data-reveal`. `#about` wraps the heading,
  profile, and existing Skills placeholder. `#AboutMeNavigation` remains an
  alias on the About heading for older links.
- Navbar slots follow page order: 0 Home, 1 Projects, 2 About, 3 Contact.
  Anchor targets determine the mapping. The circle uses actual element offsets
  and widths, including navbar padding, so it stays centered on mobile.
- Scroll tracking uses one requestAnimationFrame update and a reading line at
  35% of the viewport height, with a bottom-of-page fallback. Do not restore the
  old 800 ms click lock or observe missing/empty marker elements.
- IntersectionObserver toggles `is-visible` on every entry/exit. Sections stay
  in layout; never use `display: none` to hide observer targets. A small head
  script adds `reveal-enabled` before first paint. `main.js` adds `reveal-ready`
  after observation starts; DOMContentLoaded removes the hiding gate if setup
  failed. Without JavaScript or observer support, content remains visible.
- The reveal is `sectionReveal 0.85s ease-out 0.25s both` in `style.css`.
  Sections remain transparent during the delay and replay after leaving and
  re-entering the viewport. The user specifically requested this repeat behavior
  and the short pause. Keep the circle's existing movement animation.
- Twenty background dots move at different speeds with scrolling, with a small
  horizontal drift. They wrap outside the viewport and share the navigation
  animation-frame update. No continuous idle animation loop is needed.
- `#toggle` now lives inside `.navbar`, anchored to that fixed container. On
  desktop it sits to the left; at widths <=768 px it slides into the bar over
  0.5 seconds. Mobile uses a 48 px theme button, flexible navigation slots,
  viewport gutters, and a bottom safe-area inset. Theme state persists in
  localStorage; the button's label and pressed state update with it.
- Reduced-motion preferences disable fades, docking/circle transitions, dot
  movement, and CSS smooth scrolling.

### Files and verification

Implementation changes are in `index.html`, `main.js`, and `style.css`.
The React sources/bundle, original header SVG, contact submission flow, and
Worker were not changed; no React rebuild was needed.

`node --check main.js` and `git diff --check` passed. Firefox checks passed for
initial hiding, repeated fades, navigation in both directions, dot movement,
reduced motion, and the missing-main.js fallback. Responsive checks at 320,
390, 768, 769, and 1280 px covered fixed positioning, button docking, touch
target sizes, circle alignment, mouse/keyboard theme switching, and persistence.
Third-party requests were blocked during these local UI checks; contact email
delivery and external icon/font services were not retested.

The browser harness and Playwright installation were temporary, outside the
repository, under `/tmp/portfolio-scroll-check.sthZGS/`; do not assume they
survive another session. This handoff is tracked despite `cloude/` being ignored.
The older conversation log remains local.

Next-session note: keep the monochrome style and restrained movement. Tune the
reveal delay/duration in CSS if asked, and preserve repeat-on-entry behavior.
The older deployment/domain/secret-rotation follow-ups were not addressed in
this UI session; check their current status before acting on old notes.

## 2026-09-09

The contact form keeps its existing submission flow. After the Worker accepts a message, `main.js` hides `#contactForm` and reveals `#contactThanks`.

`#contactThanks` now uses an inline SVG success icon:

- the outlined circle draws first;
- the checkmark draws immediately after;
- the animation restarts whenever the hidden success panel is revealed;
- reduced-motion users see the completed icon without animation.

The relevant files are `index.html` and `style.css`. The header animation is intentionally left as the user's original asset; do not replace or rewrite it without an explicit request.
